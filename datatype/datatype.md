Every programing language has its own data types for deceleration and storage of variable in memory allocating spaces 
to the variable used by them to give it one must know datatype and on the utilization of data passed one has to know it 
to work smoothly without any problem in running programs. 

Datatype present in c++ are:
```cpp
#include<string> //header file importing string
using namespace std;
int b = 10;
long c =882733829202822828299292929;
float c = 72.672;
double d = 82882822.82829299;
string name="Hello world!" ;
```
In the above code syntax I declared all the data types that can be used in cpp language. 
Int can handle real numbers and non decimal number upto limit of 10^32.
Long can handle all real numbers greater than int and can store all values in it.
